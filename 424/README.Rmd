This is an incomplete test.  It will only work for me, since the landsat data
are much too large to put here.  

As I started work on bug, I realized that ocedata should have a landsat
dataset, and this (Cape Split) would be a cool region to highlight.  But I
think I should decimate it somewhat and then add all channels.  Since I've not
yet coded decimation as a separate routine (or reading all channels!!) I'll
have to come back to the issue of the dataset, and I'll do that once this bug
is fixed, probably Monday.
